# CryptoBotHunter
@CryptoBotHunter publishes a detected Twitter crypto bot every hour https://twitter.com/CryptoBotHunter

## How to run it
In order to run it properly you need to replace the `consumer_key`, `consumer_secret`, `access_token`, `access_secret` and `pastebin_dev_key` in **secrets.py**.

## How to contribute
I'm far from being a Python expert, contributions are more than welcome!
